# Reinforcement Learning B Models

## Getting started

1. Install ProB2-UI in its latest nightly version as available here: https://github.com/hhu-stups/prob2_ui
2. Load the `RL_Project.prob2project` and start a formal model (`HighwayEnvironment2.mch` in this example)

3. Open SimB in ProB2-UI

4. Load a SimB simulation which starts an RL agent (extension `.py`). In this example, it is `HighwayEnvironment_Higher_Penalty_Collision.py`

## Evaluation

This part describes the instructions to re-produce our evaluation results for the RL agent of the Highway Environment.
These are the Python and B machine files to start the `Base` and `Higher Penalty` Agents with and without shielding.

|                  | RL Agent                                         |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `Base`           | `HighwayEnvironment_Base.py`                     |
| `Higher Penalty` | `HighwayEnvironment_Higher_Penalty_Collision.py` |

|             | Machine                   |
|-------------|---------------------------|
| `No Shield` | `HighwayEnvironment.mch`  |
| `Shield`    | `HighwayEnvironment2.mch` |

For example: In order to re-run the `Base` agent without `Shielding`, one would have to load `HighwayEnvironment.mch` with `HighwayEnvironment_Base.py` via SimB
As the RL agents' behavior are non-deterministic, particularly, probabilistic, the evaluation results might differ when re-running the agents for specific number of simulations.
For our evaluation results, we have saved the traces that were generated as shown below:


|                                | Saved Traces                                                                  |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Base` + `No Shield`           | Open `HighwayEnvironment.mch`, load `Traces_Base`                             |
| `Base` + `Shield`              | Open `HighwayEnvironment2.mch`, load `Traces_Base_Shield`                     |
| `Higher Penalty` + `No Shield` | Open `HighwayEnvironment.mch`, load `Traces_Higher_Penalty_Collision`         |
| `Higher Penalty` + `Shield`    | Open `HighwayEnvironment2.mch`, load `Traces_Higher_Penalty_Collision_Shield` |

For example: In order to re-run the results for `Base` + `No Shield` exacly with the same traces, it is necessary to open `HighwayEnvironment.mch` and load
the set of timed traces `Traces_Base` via SimB.


### Results

In the following, we show the results of applying SimB's statistical validation techniques to the RL agent of the Highway Environment.
The corresponding validation tasks are part of the ProB2-UI project `RL_Project.prob2project` in the corresponding machines.
They can be executed via the left-hand side of the SimB window.

Example: In order to re-produce the results of Total Reward for `Base without shield`, one has to open `HighwayEnvironment.mch` and run the SimB validation task which computes the sum of `Reward` in `Traces_Base`.

Example: In order to re-produce the results of `SAF1` for `Base without shield`, one has to open `HighwayEnvironment.mch` and run the SimB validation task which checks `Crash = FALSE` as an invariant for all simulated traces.


## Implementation overview

### Training of agents

Setup:

```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The agent for the Highway Environment can be trained or tested via Command Line:

```bash
# To train a new model (save under models/highway_env):
python highway_agent.py train


# Loads the trained model and runs and renders episodes over its behaviour:
python highway_agent.py test
```
